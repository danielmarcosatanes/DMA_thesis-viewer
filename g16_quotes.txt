ENTER PHYSICS, CHEMISTRY, BIO THEY SPRANG UP AROUND THE NILE. BUT CHEMISTRY SURPASSED THE REST FAR AND AWAY IT WAS THE BEST. EXPERIMENT WAS GOD'S DECREE EXPERIMENT DID CHEMISTS WITH LOTS OF GLEE BUT SOON THEIR TESTS BEGAN TO BOG, THEY FOUND THEMSELVES DEEP IN A FOG. "GIVE US SOME HELP" THEY CRIED TO GOD. GOD LOOKED AROUND, THEN GAVE THE NOD. ENTER EINSTEIN, HEISENBERG, BOHR, REACTION PATHS WERE CLEAR ONCE MORE. WITH THEORISTS GOD SEND DIRECTION AND THEN HE STOPPED, HE'D MADE PERFECTION. -- THOMAS A.

  EXPERIENCE IS THE FRUIT OF THE TREE OF ERRORS.

  EXPERIMENTALISTS THINK SILICON IS REALLY FUN TO USE ITS PLACE IN NOVEL COMPOUNDS IS CERTAIN TO AMUSE THEY SIT ALL DAY IN LABORATORIES MAKING ALL THIS SLUDGE "LOADED WITH THE SILICON THEY SAY", TO ME IT LOOKS LIKE FUDGE. FOR HAPPY THOUGH THEY BE WITH CRUD, I'D LIKE TO KNOW A LITTLE ABOUT THE PI BONDS ON THE EDGE AND SIGMAS IN THE MIDDLE.  SO LETS DERIVE A WAVEFUNCTION.....6-31G* USE AN OPTIMAL GEOMETRY AND SEE WHERE ELECTRONS ARE. BUT WHAT OF CORRELATION?  ASKS THE WIRY LITTLE SKEPTIC. WE'LL THROW IN PERTURBATION AS AN ELECTRON ANTISEPTIC. AND WHEN THE PROGRAM GIVES US ANSWERS IN THEM WE CAN TRUST SINCE NOBODY CAN MAKE THE STUFF, WE HAVE NO CHOICE, WE MUST.  SO THEORY GUYS HAVE GOT IT MADE, IN ROOMS FREE OF POLLUTION. INSTEAD OF PROBLEMS WITH THE REFLUX, THEY HAVE ONLY SOLUTIONS. AND WHEN THE FEDS ANNOUNCE THE LIST OF CARCINOGENIC TERRORS, THE THEORISTS SIT SAFELY AT THEIR TERMINALS FIXING ERRORS. IN OTHER WORDS, EXPERIMENTALISTS WILL LIKELY DIE OF CANCER FROM WORKING HARD YET FRUITLESSLY...TILL THEORY GIVES THE ANSWER. -- THOMAS A. HOLME, 1983

  FRICTION IS A DRAG, AND ENTROPY AIN'T WHAT IT USED TO BE.

  FROM AN ANONYMOUS WRITER, ON PERSPECTIVE:  MAN, DESPITE HIS ARTISTIC PRETENSIONS, HIS SOPHISTICATION AND MANY ACCOMPLISHMENTS, OWES THE FACT OF HIS EXISTENCE TO A SIX-INCH LAYER OF TOPSOIL AND THE FACT THAT IT RAINS.

  FROM THE ASHES OF OUR DESPAIR GROW THE FLOWERS OF TOMORROW.

  FROM WHENCE IT HAPPENS, THAT THEY WHICH TRUST TO BOOKS, DO AS THEY THAT CAST UP MANY LITTLE SUMMS INTO GREATER, WITHOUT CONSIDERING WETHER THOSE LITTLE SUMMES WERE RIGHTLY CAST UP OR NOT...

  I (ERNEST RUTHERFORD) CAME INTO THE ROOM, WHICH WAS HALF DARK, AND PRESENTLY SPOTTED LORD KELVIN IN THE AUDIENCE AND REALIZED I WAS IN TROUBLE AT THE LAST PART OF MY SPEECH DEALING THE AGE OF THE EARTH, WHERE MY VIEWS CONFLICTED WITH HIS.  TO MY RELIEF KELVIN FELL FAST ASLEEP, BUT AS I CAME TO THE IMPORTANT POINT, I SAW THE OLD BIRD SIT UP AND COCK A BALEFUL GLANCE AT ME! THEN A SUDDEN INSPIRATION CAME AND I SAID LORD KELVIN HAD LIMITED THE AGE OF THE EARTH PROVIDED NO NEW SOURCE WAS DISCOVERED.

  IF I AM NOT FOR MYSELF, WHO WILL BE? BUT IF I AM ONLY FOR MYSELF, WHAT AM I? THOUGH A SEEKER SINCE MY BIRTH, HERE IS ALL I'VE LEARNED ON EARTH, THIS IS THE GIST OF WHAT I KNOW: GIVE ADVICE AND BUY A FOE.
